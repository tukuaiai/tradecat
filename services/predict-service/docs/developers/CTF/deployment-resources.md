Polymarket provides code samples in both Python and TypeScript for interacting

with our smart chain contracts. You will need an RPC endpoint to access the

blockchain, and you’ll be responsible for paying gas fees when executing these

RPC/function calls. Please ensure you’re using the correct example for your wallet

type (Safe Wallet vs Proxy Wallet) when implementing.
