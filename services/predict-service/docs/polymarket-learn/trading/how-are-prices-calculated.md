What is a Prediction Market?

On this page

Initial Price

Future Price

Prices = Probabilities

​

Initial Price

When a market is created, there are initially zero shares and no pre-defined prices or odds.

Market makers (a fancy term for traders placing limit orders) interested in buying YES or NO shares can place

Limit Orders

at the price they’re willing to pay

When offers for the YES and NO side equal $1.00, the order is “matched” and that $1.00 is converted into 1 YES and 1 NO share, each going to their respective buyers.

For example, if you place a limit order at $0.60 for YES, that order is matched when someone places a NO order at $0.40.

This becomes the initial market price.

​

Future Price

The prices displayed on Polymarket are the midpoint of the bid-ask spread in the orderbook — unless that spread is over $0.10, in which case the last traded price is used.

Like the stock market, prices on Polymarket are a function of realtime supply & demand.

​

Prices = Probabilities

In the market below, the probability of 37% is the midpoint between the 34¢ bid and 40¢ ask. If the bid-ask spread is wider than 10¢, the probability is shown as the last traded price.

You may not be able to buy shares at the displayed probability / price because there is a bid-ask spread. In the above example, a trader wanting to buy shares would pay 40¢ for up to 4,200 shares, after which the price would rise to 43¢.
