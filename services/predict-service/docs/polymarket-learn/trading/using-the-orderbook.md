In the Getting Started tutorial on

Making your First Trade

, we learned about market orders.

In a market order, your trade executes instantly at the current market price.

But what if you think the market price is too high and want to set a specific price that you would be willing to accept? These are called

Limit Orders

.

​

Viewing the Order Book

The order book is a list of every open order to buy or sell shares in a particular market.

In this market,

“Presidential Election Winner 2024”

, we are viewing the order book for Trump

Yes

shares.

The green side represents the

Bids

: the highest price traders are willing to pay to buy Trump

Yes

shares.

The red side represents the

Asks

: the lowest price traders are willing to accept to sell Trump

Yes

shares.

Notice that there is a 0.3c gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask price. This is referred to as the spread.

​
