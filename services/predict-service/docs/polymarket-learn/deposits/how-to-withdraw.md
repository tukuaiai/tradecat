What is a Prediction Market?

Withdrawing from Polymarket is simple, instant, and free.

Note: When withdrawing USDC.e (bridged USDC) is swapped through the

Uniswap v3 pool

for USDC (native) (the UI enforces less than 10bp difference in output

amount). At times, this pool may be exhausted and for extremely large deposits

there might not be enough liquidity. If you are having withdraw issues, try

breaking your withdraw into smaller amounts or waiting for the pool to be

rebalanced. Additionally, you can select to withdraw USDC.e directly which

does not require any Uniswap liquidity; just be aware that some exchanges no

longer allow USDC.e to be deposited directly.
