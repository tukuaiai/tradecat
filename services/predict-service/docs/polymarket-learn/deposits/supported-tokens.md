How do I use Transfer Crypto?

The feature was designed to be one of the simplest ways to transfer your tokens into a dApp.

Click on the Deposit button

and

select Transfer Crypto

as a source option

Select which supported token and chain

your assets are on from the dropdown

Depending on your combination, this

may update the deposit address

Only send

supported token-chain combinations

Sending non-supported tokens may cause an irrecoverable loss

Scan the QR code or copy the deposit address

and paste as the recipient in the withdrawal/transfer page of your exchange/wallet

This is where you’ll specify how much crypto you’re transferring

You

must send more than the minimum deposit

amount or the funds will not process

Always ensure to

double check the pasted address

versus that is shown on the widget to protect against clickjacking attempts

You can click on the

collapsible section at the bottom of the widget

for estimated price impact, slippage, delivery time, and our help guide

Withdraw/transfer the tokens

from your exchange/wallet and wait until they’re reflected on the dApp

You will receive notifications on the Fun widget as your withdraw/transfer processes and completes as shown below
