Overview

Clarifications

​

Overview

Markets are resolved according to the rules set forth on the market page.

The rules specify the resolution source, the market end date, and they outline how the market should resolve in various edge-cases.

The market title describes the market, but the rules define how it should be resolved.

​

Clarifications

In rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a market’s creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an “Additional context” update to the rules.

If you believe a clarification is necessary for a market, the best place to request a clarification is in the

Polymarket Discord

#market-review

channel.

An example clarification in the market on what Trump would say during Hannity Town Hall.
