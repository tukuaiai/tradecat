There are two levels of authentication to be considered when using Polymarket’s CLOB.

All signing can be handled directly by the client libraries.

This is information for advanced users who are NOT using our

Python

or

Typescript

Clients. Our provided clients handle signing and authentication for you.

​

L1: Private Key Authentication

The highest level of authentication is via an account’s Polygon private key.

The private key remains in control of a user’s funds and all trading is non-custodial.

The operator

never

has control over users’ funds.

Private key authentication is required for:

Placing an order (for signing the order)

Creating or revoking API keys

​

L1 Header

Header

Required?

Description

POLY_ADDRESS

yes

Polygon address

POLY_SIGNATURE

yes

CLOB EIP 712 signature

POLY_TIMESTAMP

yes

Current UNIX timestamp

POLY_NONCE

yes

Nonce. Default 0

The

POLY_SIGNATURE

is generated by signing the following EIP-712 struct.

Implementations exist in:

Typescript

Python

​

,

}

signer._signTypedData(domain, types, value)

​

L2: API Key Authentication

The next level of authentication consists of the API key, secret, and passphrase.

These are used solely to authenticate API requests made to Polymarket’s CLOB, such as posting/canceling orders or retrieving an account’s orders and fills.

When a user on-boards via:

Copy

Ask AI

POST

/auth/api-key

the server uses the signature as a seed to deterministically generate credentials.

An API credential includes:

key

: UUID identifying the credentials

secret

: Secret string used to generate HMACs (not sent with requests)

passphrase

: Secret string sent with each request, used to encrypt/decrypt the secret (never stored)

All private endpoints require an API key signature (

L2 Header

).
